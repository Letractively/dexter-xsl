The first example of using dexter will feature no special attrbiuteas at all.  We are going to take an arbitrary XML document, and compile it through dexter.
{{{
[michael@fedora14 test-ident]$ cat source.xml
<tests>
	<div id="group-2" >
			a record
		<div  >
		something here
		</div>

	
		<div >
			<span >one </span>
			<span >two </span>
			<span >three </span>
			<span >four </span>
		</div>
	</div>
</tests>

[michael@fedora14 test-ident]$ dexter.sh source.xml 
}}}

This produces the output file `source.xml.xsl`.  Transforming any XML input with this style sheet produces a replica of the original input file.

{{{
[michael@fedora14 test-ident]$ xsltproc source.xml.xsl data.xml 
<tests>
	<div id="group-2">
			a record
		<div>
		something here
		</div>

	
		<div>
			<span>one </span>
			<span>two </span>
			<span>three </span>
			<span>four </span>
		</div>
	</div>
</tests>

}}} 

Through the two-step process of compiling with dexter and using the resulting XSL with any XSLT-1.0 compliant processor, any XML file which is not annotated with dexter attributes becomes it's own source.
