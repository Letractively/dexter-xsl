Dexter is a tool for creating XSLT-1.0 from  well-formed XML example documents.  It uses a collection of attributes to indicate required operations.

 == Usage ==
The Dexter includes
 == Entities ==
Dexter uses JAXP to parse well-formed XML of any type: HTML, RSS, Soap responses,etc.  Unlike HMTL, it is an error to use undeclared entities in XML.  For most HTML fomats, this is as simple as declaring a DTD at the top of your document.

{{{
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
}}}

For users of HTML5, the doctype is just `<!DOCTYPE html>` which, unfortunately, does not declare any entities to the parser.  A reasonable workaround is to declare you entities in the document itself.
{{{
<!DOCTYPE html[
  <!ENTITY nbsp "&#160;">
]>
}}}

 == JAXP ==

The default JAXP parser built into Java is flawed and does some very odd things with entities sometimes.  I recommend that you make the xerces parser (bundled) available on your class path for best results.
