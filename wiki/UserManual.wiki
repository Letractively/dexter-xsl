== Dexter Operators ==
 Most of Dexters operators are XML-agnostic; that is to say they are useful regardless of the scheme of XML being manipulated.  Those are the attributes in the 'dx' namespace.  There are a few HTML-specific operators which are in the 'dd' namespace.

Many dexter operators require XPath 1.0 in their arguments with additional, optional prefixes.
