== Xpath 1.0 ==
In keeping with the XSLT 1.0 specification, dexter uses XPath 1.0 (XML Path Language, version 1.0) in many of it's operators. An in-depth discussion beyond the scope of this document, and you should refer to the [http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/ XML Path Language (XPath) 1.0 standard] for definitive information. 

A useful resource for those new to XPath or who desire a refresher in the basics is the [http://zvon.org/xxl/XPathTutorial/General/examples.html Zvon.org XPath Tutorial], which is available in several languages.


== Dexter Operators ==
 Most of Dexters operators are XML-agnostic; that is to say they are useful regardless of the scheme of XML being manipulated.  Those are the attributes in the 'dx' namespace.  There are a few HTML-specific operators which are in the 'dd' namespace.

Many dexter operators require XPath 1.0 in their arguments with additional, optional prefixes.
