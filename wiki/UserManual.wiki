== Dexter Operators ==
 Most of Dexters operators are XML-agnostic; that is to say they are useful regardless of the scheme of XML being manipulated.  THose are the attributes in the 'dx' namespace.  There are a few HTML-specific operators in the 'dd' namespace.

=== dx:text ===

  simple text substitution

*text* replaces all child nodes of the current source element with the text content of the data node specified by the path.

A optional prefix '!' may be used to retain the value in the source document as a default:
{{{
 data.xml

<xml>
  <person>
     <firstname>John</firstname>
  </person>
</xml>
}}}
{{{
 dexter source 
<div class="person" dx:text="person/firstname">unknown</div> 
<div class="person" dx:text="!person/middlename">unknown</div> 
<div class="person" dx:text="person/lastname">unknown</div> 
}}}
  this renders as
{{{
<div class="person">John</div> 
<div class="person">unknown</div> 
<div class="person"></div> 
}}}
